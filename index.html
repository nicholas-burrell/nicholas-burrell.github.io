    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>With a passion for cybersecurity, I deliver tailored solutions to clients' IT concerns as a Computer Technician at Mountain West Computers. I diagnose and resolve hardware and software issues across various platforms, ensuring optimal system functionality and customer satisfaction. I also provide technical support and training to end-users, as well as preventive maintenance and security updates to systems.</p>
    <p>Beyond the realm of technology,  I proudly volunteered for my Church, embarking on a two-year journey in the Philippines. During my experience, I engaged in numerous service projects, including the construction of homes and the harvesting of food for local communities along with sharing our message. This period not only broadened my cultural horizons but also instilled in me a sense of compassion and adaptability. I also became fluent in Cebuano, creating connections through language and understanding.</p>
    <p>I love the outdoors, whether it's hiking along scenic trails with my wife and daughter or carving through the snow on a snowboard. </p>
